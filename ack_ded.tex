\begin{acknowledgments}
  To be finalized

  % In many other programs with many other advisors, mentors, and peers, I might not have finished my PhD. I have been extraordinarily lucky to have stumbled from one mentor exemplifying dedication, kindness, selflessness, and the height of competency to another, providing me with an ideal container to start my academic career.

  % In order to understand the Milky Way one must first exist in it, and for that I have to thank my parents, Anne and Tim Beane. No matter who I become or what I choose to do, they have repeatedly ensured that I understand I have their unconditional love and support. They dedicated nearly three decades of their lives to raising myself and my siblings. Enumerating all of their sacrifices would lead the university to consider implementing a strict page limit on acknowledgments. 

  % As the youngest, my siblings have literally always been there for me. 

  % I was encouraged by numerous teachers to pursue all my interests, including not just in physics. The math and science specialty center gave me an environment to see what science is at an early stage. I learned a lot from my teachers, including Mrs. Cope, Mrs. Delano, Mr. Fetsko, Mr. Gallo, and Mrs. Watson.

  % However, no one was as impactful during my high school years than Todd Phillips, my AP Statistics teacher. He sacrificed more than could ever be expected from a teacher in terms of time and energy because he wanted every student to achieve their full potential. He stayed after school and led nearly 20 review sessions, half of them late in the evening so that student athletes could attend. At these review sessions, I learned so much more than statistics. When I went to college, I would visit and enthusiastically tell him about all I was learning -- my way of saying thank you. He left us too early.

  % My time in high school was supplemented by work at the University of Richmond, where I had a unique opportunity to conduct research in the computational chemistry lab of Carol Parish. I was incredibly lucky to have benefited from her deep commitment to the advancement of so many young scientists. And I learned so many lessons from the many direct interactions of Prof. Dr. Billy Miller, III, PhD, including to approach science with very serious levity.

  % During the formative years of my undergrad, I had the great fortune of interacting with a large number of excellent teachers, including Mirjam Cvetic, Herman Gluck, A.~T. Charlie Johnson, Justin Khoury, Alexandre Kirillov, Phil Nelson, Masao Sako, and Ravi Sheth. But my most meaningful interaction with the department was through my advisor Adam Lidz, who patiently advised me from the day I started undergrad as I slowly got up to speed until I could say one or two useful things. He was so generous with his time, and he is an advocate I know I can count on for the rest of my career.

  % I am also thankful to the Roy \& Diana Vagelos Molecular Life Sciences Program -- in particular to the co-director Ponzy Lu for allowing me to interlope as a physicist (and, in doing so, evade some of the requirements). With the generous financial support that the program provided, I was able to do the research that put me on the track I am on now. And the program itself pushed me to better myself as a scientist. I made many good friends through this program who helped me along the way, including the OG4: Tibby, Josh, and Ivan. Tibby, in particular, was a highly needed source of strength during those years.

  % I was also fortunate during my undergrad to spend some time at the CCA, where I saw with my own eyes the power and utility of astronomy's open and collaborative culture. My mentors Melissa Ness, Megan Bedell, Robyn Sanderson, and Mordecai-Mark Mac Low gave me the guidance and environment to mature as a scientist. I am so thankful to them, along with the many postdocs and faculty in the area, including Daniel Angl\'es-Alc\'azar, Shy Genel, David Hogg, Kathryn Johnston, Chervin Laporte, Sarah Pearson, and Adrian Price-Whelan. I cannot wait to return to NYC.

  % Deep gratitude as well to the extensive lineage of vipassan\={a} teachers and practitioners. To Medawi, Ledi Sayadaw, and Mahasi Sayadaw for reintroducing and popularizing ancient meditation techniques, and the many before who preserved them. To Sayadaw U Tejaniya for a creative style of practice that has been highly compatible with my nervous system and deeply helpful during my PhD. And to the teachers I have sat on retreat with: Ajahn Amaro, Devin Berry, Rebecca Bradshaw, Chas DiCapua, Shelly Graf, Matthew Hepburn, Ayya Khemak\={a}, Cara Lai, Neesha Patel, Alexis Santos, Greg Scharf, and Carol Wilson -- especially to Shelly. And to the many friends also on the path.

  % To the so many friends I have made during my PhD: 

  % Chima
  % Lieke


  % . And to Kiernan, Dan, Billy, Ivan, Mike, Andy, Sweenie, OG Josh, Speags, 

  % To the officemates: Lieke, Chris, and Jesse. e

  % As part of Lars' group, I have had the fortune of interacting with a wide network of collaborators, including

  % To Alyssa and Charlie, and their groups, many thanks for allowing me to hitch a ride -- or in some cases hijack. I remember fondly the times of making the group spend 15 minutes trying to understand how stairs work or 30 minutes drawing with colored pencils. Some good science also happened. I have always felt like a part of their groups. During some of the most difficult periods of my PhD, Charlie never wavered in his support for me, and for that I am eternally grateful. They, along with the other members of the committee, Lisa and Tom, have provided me with

  % And to my partner and best friend, Elena. When we first met, it felt like I was talking to an old friend. She is always right there beside me, ready to defend and support. She has a deep heart that can hold all beings, and the energy to act on it. She is the love of my life, and I look forward to ``spending a really long time'' together.

  % And to my advisor, Lars. His words are remarkable not for their number but for their quality. I have learned so much not only from what he knows and how he thinks about science, but also how he treats his students, his groups, and the community at large. He is an impeccable prioritizer stemming from an unmatched talent for discerning what is important. And when I had lost faith in myself, I borrowed some from him -- and he had so much to give.

  % Finally, I would like to offer unconditional forgiveness for any harm that anyone has done to me over the course of my PhD, whether intentional or unintentional. And I would like to ask for forgiveness for any harm that I have done to others over the course of my PhD, whether intentional or unintentional.
